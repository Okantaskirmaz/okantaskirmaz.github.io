# Research Projects

Hello! Welcome to my portfolio repository. These are the workings of some projects during my stint as a Senior Research Asst. at SUTD (and my graduation thesis from TU Delft). My work here delved into urban challenges of modern cities and the different approaches used to tackle them: community engagement through participatory design, GIS and data science. Each link leads to an elaboration of each phase and the documentation in code.
