# Minor, (Re)Imagining Port Cities: Understanding Space, Society and Culture

The final part of the minor, focuses on how the Maasboulevard near the Rhijnspoorkade in Rotterdam could evolve into a sustainable and maritime public space for the future. Positioned along the Nieuwe Maas, the site offers a unique interface between the city and the river, a place where movement, ecology, and leisure converge.
